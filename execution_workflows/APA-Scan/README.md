# APA-Scan
APA-Scan detects the potential Alternative Polyadenylation (APA) events in the downstream 3'-UTR of a gene among two different biological conditions.

# Installation
APA-Scan is a python tool which can be downloaded directly from github. Python (version 3.0 or higher) is required to be installed on users machine to run APA-Scan. It can work on Windows, Linux and Mac platform.

Users need to update the configuration.ini file and run the specific file APA-Scan.py to demonstrate the APA events.

$python3 APA-Scan.py

To generate plots for any selected 3'-UTR region, users need to run makePlots.py and provide input in a specific pattern: chromName:geneName:start-end

$python3 Make-plots.py
